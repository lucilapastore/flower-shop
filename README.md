# HTML & CSS capstone project: Flower shop

[Project specifications](https://www.notion.so/HTML-CSS-capstone-project-Flower-shop-36dadb9944f040618db0de47cd6f68d6).

Capstone projects are solo projects at the end of each section of the Microverse Curriculum. 

Building this project was very important for me because:
It was a real-world-like project, built with business specifications.
I got feedback about the achievement of technical and soft skills gained during this section of the program.
I personalized this project, so now I have something unique to share with potential employers during my job search.

Developing the project, I followed the best practices that I already learned in the previous projects, like setting-up a code linter, using Github flow, making good commit messages and writing a good README.
